    1. Changes *should* follow contributing notes in the [code style](#code-style) and [script format](#script-format) sections
    2. Commits *should* follow contributing notes in the [git](#git) section
    3. Changes *should* pass all tests in the repository test suite
    4. Changes *should* update any required documentation or tests
    5. Changes on the new branch must *not* be merged into the main branch before making a pull request
4. Make a pull request which *must* complete the pull request template provided for this repository

Please note that this repository is maintained primarily by a solo developer. As such, it may take longer than expected for pull requests to be reviewed. If your changes are important and/or time critical for your personal use case, please consider forking this repository and maintaining that fork instead.

## Issues

If you encounter an issue whilst using this repository or any software released by it, please submit an issue using the [issue tracker for this repository](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/js-template/issues). Issues for this repository are tracked using the default [github](https://github.com) issue tracker ([see here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues) for more information on managing repository issues on [github](https://github.com)).

## Git

This repository uses git for version control. Please consult the following subheadings for information on the preferred git commit format used in this repository, and for other guidelines to consider when making a pull request with changes you have made to this repository. The following notes form the git "best practices" for this repository.

### Lightweight Commit Format

This repository uses the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits) for formatting git commits. The [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits) is largely based on the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with modifications to allow for terser commit titles. Where possible, contributors should familiarise themselves with the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits) and use it to format their commits, however the format is not a strict requirement for making contributions. 

If you are not intending on contributing to this repository regularly, then feel free to use commits using another standard such as the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) mentioned above or these [commit message guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53), making sure that your commits meet the following minimum standards:

1. Commits *must* be formatted consistently for all your changes
2. Any prose title description *must* start with an imperative form verb, for example `Add feature` or `Fix bug`
3. Any prose title description *should* start with a capital letter, and should *not* end with a period

### Branch Naming

If you are contributing to this repository, and are intending on making a pull request, please first make a new branch. Any changes should be made on this new branch. All branches in this repository should be named according to the following rules:

1. Words in each part of the branch name *must* be separated by a `-` (i.e. each part of the branch name must be in `lower-kebab-case`)
2. Each part of the branch name *must* be separated by a `/`
3. Branch names *must* be formed of some or all of the following parts in order:
    1. Type of changes in the branch (see table below for options)
    2. Reference number for branch if applicable (for instance issue number if branch resolves an issue)
    3. Author name or reference (for example github username or name given when calling `git config --get user.name`)
    4. Brief branch description

For example `feature/123/jimbob3806/implement-slider`

| Branch Type | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| feature     | Branch which implements a new or changed feature.                                                               |
| bug         | Branch which fixes a reported or observed bug.                                                                  |
| performance | Branch which fixes a performance issue.                                                                         |
| security    | Branch which fixes a security vulnerability.                                                                    |
| dependency  | Branch which updates a dependency, and changes code as required depending on the new version of the dependency. |
| refactor    | Branch which refactors a part of the codebase (predominantly changes which do not change how code functions).   |
| rewrite     | Branch which rewrites a part of the codebase (significant changes to how the code functions).                   |
| remove      | Branch which removes a section of the codebase, and changes code as required to facilitate the removal.         |
| docs        | Branch which only updates documentation.                                                                        |
| test        | Branch which only updates the test suite.                                                                       |
| other       | Any other Branch.                                                                                               |

### Developer Environments

Developer environment files such as a workspace `./.vscode` directory must *not* be committed to the repository. Additionally the `.gitignore` in the root of the repository should not be responsible for excluding developer environments. This is in the interest of preventing one-off entries in the `.gitignore` file for uncommon developer environment files etc.

Preferably developers contributing to this repository should avoid the use of workspace configuration files for their developer environment, favouring instead a global user configuration file such as a `.vimrc` file. If you are contributing to this repository and have to use workspace configuration files for your developer environment, please ensure that you follow the following steps:

1. Make new branch for all your changes
2. *Before* your first commit on new branch, update the `.gitignore` file to ensure that no configuration files appear in the git history, and commit these changes with a commit title of `cfg~ Modify .gitignore`
3. Make your changes as required on your new branch
4. *After* your last commit, remove your workspace configuration files, revert the `.gitignore` file, and commit these changes with a commit title of `cfg~ Modify .gitignore`

## Code Style

Primarily this repository uses a custom configuration of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style.

### ESLint

This repository uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as the primary tool for the standardisation of JavaScript and TypeScript source code files. Note that [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is primarily responsible for source code formatting within this repository, although some linting rules are also intended for preventing code which may give rise to logical errors.

#### Configuration



#### Checking

To run ESLint manually across the source code files in this project, please see the [npm scripts reference](#npm-scripts), or run `npm run lint:check`. 

#### Linting



#### Overrides



### Ternaries



### Paths

./ at the start of relative paths if possible

### Module Imports

relative imports rather than absolute imports, and ignore using custom imports in package.json

### Comment Grammar

### Template



## Getting Around

This repository is generated from a template repository which may be viewed [here](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/js-template). Please see the following subheadings for descriptions of the purpose and use of the root directories included in the template repository. Note that other directories and architectures may be added by the maintainer(s) after duplicating the template. These additions will obviously have their own purpose(s), some of which may not be described below.

### .cache

The `./.cache` directory is included in this repository by use of a `.gitkeep` file, otherwise the contents of the `./.cache` directory are untracked by the `.gitignore` file. The `./.cache` directory is reserved for cache files of repository build scripts etc. These include the cache for ESLint, parcel bundler, and any other script which needs to cache local data in order to make subsequent executions of that script faster, or consume fewer system resources.

### .github

The `.github` directory contains some or all files relating to [github](https://github.com) and the management of the repository community (think code of conduct, templates for issues and pull requests etc.). Primarily this repository uses the `./.github` directory for specific issue templates ([see below](#issue-templates)) and for a specific pull request template. For more information specifically on adding a pull request template for a github repository, [see here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates). For more information on the general usage of the `./.github` directory in a repository hosted on [github](https://github.com), please see [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/). Note that although it may be included in the `./.github` directory, in the case of this repository, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is *not* stored in the `./.github` directory. Instead the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file may be found in the root of the repository. This is simply because the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is a more universal file which may be expected to be found in the root of any repository regardless of where that repository may be hosted.

#### Issue Templates

Issue templates are stored in the `./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` subdirectory. Each yaml file in this directory creates an issue template which consumers of the repository may use to report a bug, security vulnerability etc. For more information on creating issue templates, see the [github](https://github.com) documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms). For information relating specifically to the syntax for the [github](https://github.com) form schema, please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).

### admin

The `./admin` directory

#### Config

The `./admin/config` subdirectory contains all configuration files for tools which do not require configuration files in the root of the repository. These tools include build tools such as rollup, generators such as jsdoc and plop etc. Other configuration files such as `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc` must be located in the root of the repository in order to be found by tsserver, npm etc., and are therefore *not* found in the `./admin/config` subdirectory.

#### Scripts

The `./admin/scripts` subdirectory contains all custom scripts written by the maintainer for common repository tasks such as changelog generation upon release of a new issue. Most of these scripts can be called using `npm run admin:<script-name>`. See the [npm scripts section](#npm-scripts) for more information on all of the default available scripts.

#### Templates

The `./admin/templates` subdirectory contains all templates used by plop for automatic generation of new scripts or documentation files, and by the changelog generator to render new release note prompts. Note that template files are all saved as `.hbs` (handlebars) files for syntax highlighting purposes in vscode, although some of the template files may be limited to the simpler mustache syntax (this applies mainly to the templates used by the changelog generator).

### assets

The `./assets` directory is used to store *all* repository assets. This includes images, vector files, fonts, and any other media that features in repository documentation or is used in demos of repository functionality. Note that in the event that the default `favicon.ico` file is not is deleted and no other assets are included in the repository, the `./assets` folder will still be included in git history of this repository by use of a `.gitkeep` file.
